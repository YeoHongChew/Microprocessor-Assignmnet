4) Create the new project BLINKY
5) Select STM32 F446 NUCLEO 64 as the target board.
6) Enter the project name, target language as C.
7) Open C perspective, open and view the main.c.
8) Insert code in the main loop 
HAL_Delay(1000)ï¼›
HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(LD2_GPIO_Port, LD2_Pin); // map the pin with  main.h, found the led assignment pin
9) Build and launch a debug session.
10) Debugger halts at the first statement in main loop.
